# Arrays:

## 📖 Time Complexity of Array Operations

| Operation        | Time Complexity |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Access (indexing) | **O(1)** |
| Insert at End | **O(1)** (Amortized for dynamic arrays) |
| Insert at Beginning | **O(n)** |
| Insert at Middle | **O(n)** |
| Delete from End | **O(1)** |
| Delete from Beginning | **O(n)** |
| Delete from Middle | **O(n)** |
| Search (Linear Search) | **O(n)** |
| Search (Binary Search - Sorted) | **O(log n)** |
